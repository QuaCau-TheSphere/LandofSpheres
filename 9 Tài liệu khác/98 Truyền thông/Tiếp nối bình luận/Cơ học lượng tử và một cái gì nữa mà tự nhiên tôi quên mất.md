Các tác giả của _Quantum Country_ xem nó là một *phòng thí nghiệm trí nhớ*. That is, it’s a system which can be used both to better understand how memory works, and also to develop new kinds of memory system. We’d like to answer questions such as:

-   What are new ways memory systems can be applied, beyond the simple, declarative knowledge of past systems?
-   How deep can the understanding developed through a memory system be? What patterns will help users deepen their understanding as much as possible?
-   How far can we raise the human capacity for memory? And with how much ease? What are the benefits and drawbacks?
-   Might it be that one day most human beings will have a regular _memory practice_, as part of their everyday lives? Can we make it so memory becomes a choice; is it possible to in some sense solve the problem of memory?

In the past, one of us (MN) has often helped students learn technical subjects such as quantum mechanics. He noticed that people often think they’re getting stuck on esoteric, complex issues. But, as suggested in the introduction to this essay, often what’s really going on is that they’re having a hard time with basic notation and terminology. It’s difficult to understand quantum mechanics when you’re unclear about every third word or piece of notation. Every sentence is a struggle.

It’s like they’re trying to compose a beautiful sonnet in French, but only know 200 words of French. They’re frustrated and think the trouble is the difficulty of finding a good theme, striking sentiments and images, and so on. But really the issue is that they have only 200 words with which to compose.

We’ve met many mathematicians and physicists who say that one reason they went into mathematics or physics is because they hated the rote memorization common in many subjects, and preferred subjects where it is possible to derive everything from scratch. But in conversation it quickly becomes evident that they have memorized an enormous number of concepts, connections, and facts in their discipline. It’s fascinating these people are so blind to the central role memory plays in their own thinking.
