[Christopher Alexander - Patterns in Architecture - YouTube](https://youtu.be/98LdFA-_zfA)
this is a pretty strange situation. i'm addressing a room, a whole football field, full of people, and i don't know hardly anything about what all of you do.  my uh association with you if i can call it that began
must have been two or three years ago somebody called me uh a computer scientist called me and said um
that there were a group of people here in silicon valley that would pay 3 000 to have dinner with me. i thought what the hell is this
so be nice to me

Bài nói chuyện gồm 3 phần:
1. Pattern và pattern language: những nghiên cứu của tác giả, những vấn đề hiện có, why we did it how we did it. Lịch sử tới những năm 60 và 70
2. Tóm tắt khung lý thuyết được sinh ra từ đó (hay nói cách khác là tóm tắt cuốn The Nature of Order) 
3. Những mối liên hệ mà Christopher thấy giữa ngành kiến trúc và ngành công nghệ thông tin

in in effect what i'll do in the in the uh in the three chords i've got here
is to tell you where my thoughts went as i
stepped through this and as i've been thinking about it during these last few months
and i ended up actually with it something that may startle you and may you you may find quite strange
but i'm i'm not going to tell you what that is just yet
so i'm going to in effect i'm just going to do three things i'm going to talk first of all about patterns and pattern languages
what i did about that a few little points about problems that we encountered why
we did it how we did it and so forth that's sort of a historical thing really referring back to
late 60s early 70s then i'm
going to summarize
the theoretical framework which has evolved out of that which is uh about to be published in a
series of volumes uh collectively called the nature of order which is a book that will be put out by
oxford university press in a few months time and that is a fairly
radical departure from what the pattern language and those theories uh contained although it is consistent
with them that'll be the second thing and i'll just try and sketch that out in the hope
that there might be some carry-over or that you might possibly find it interesting even though of course i will
have no way to directly apply this to your field when i tell you about
it that's all roughly where i got to as in spring of this year those two steps
in thinking about this and then when i when i wrote the introduction for richard gabriel's book that was really
as far as i'd got if i say what i'm doing maybe some of you folks might find it interesting or be
able to extrapolate i
couldn't really find that satisfying and i felt
that there is some more significant connection
between your field and mine or perhaps that there is and the third thing i'll talk about is
is is how i now perceive that connection
