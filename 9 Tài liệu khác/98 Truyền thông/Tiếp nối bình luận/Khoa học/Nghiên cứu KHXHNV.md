HEURIST is a research-driven data management system that puts _you_ in charge, allowing you to **design, populate, explore and publish** your own richly-structured database(s) within hours, through a simple web interface, without the need for programmers or consultants. We provide full support, including round-the clock email support, live workshops, online tutorials and access to a global network of Heurist users.


HEURIST is agile. You can **build a capable database and a CMS website in a matter of hours**, starting with a simple design and building incrementally as needs change, modifying the live database on-the-fly. Use our free servers, which support hundreds of projects and are centrally maintained. It is easy to migrate data in and out of Heurist, because of its standard, open-source design, and its ability import and export common data formats.

HEURIST is flexible. It can **effectively store, analyse and publish a wide variety of Humanities data**, whether you’re a musicologist collecting songs, an archaeologist collecting objects, or a historian collecting events. HEURIST can handle everything: text, numbers, hierarchical classifications, images, video, spatial data and dates (including non-western and approximate dates). Rich relationships between records can be built with ease.

HEURIST gets results. You can **perform sophisticated filtering**, then **save, organise and publish the results** as interactive maps, timelines, network visualisations, cross-tabulations, lists, custom reports, and a range of export formats, all of which can easily be embedded live in a website created in Heurist’s internal CMS, or in a personal or institutional website.
