Hi! Welcome to my profile. My work can be divided into two projects: *The Sphere* and *A theory of perspective*
## Project 1: The Sphere
The mission of *The Sphere* is to promote self-refection, the respect to others, the curiosity to what causes fear, and the courage to cut harmful things. The targets are people who are suffering (or creating suffering to others), yet resist others' supports to maintain status quo. This includes abusers and people who developed a worldview to justify their learned helplessness. The method is to equip their friends and loved ones the skills and knowledge to help them change their mind. For starter, read about [social work case management](https://www2.slideshare.net/esahakyan/integrated-social-services-reaching-the-most-vulnerable-training-package-for-case-managers-16096590) and [consequentialism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consequentialism).

Protectors of autonomy usually have a misconception that one's choice should always be respected, because their autonomy should always be respected. The fact is that it is only true in 99.999999% of cases, and the other 0.0000001% is people who internalized oppression. Therefore, only hoping for the best but leaving their situation intact is generally considered as undermining their autonomy. For starter, read about [relational autonomy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-autonomy) and [decision-making capacity](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/decision-capacity).

This project is written in Vietnamese. [Its website](https://quảcầu.com/?utm_source=SE%20%C2%BB%20Biology%20Profile&utm_medium=Homepage&utm_campaign=Homepage) attracted ~30k people in past year (~160 on average per day). Many of them are human right activists, psychologists, religion practitioners, academic researchers, artists, etc.
## Project 2: A theory of perspective
Imagine a floating iceberg. The part above the water is the *The Sphere* project. The part below the water is this project. It is to construct a theory for the concept "perspective", as in "keep a fresh perspective", "look at the problem in a new perspective", "put yourself in other's perspective", etc. The concept is intuitive, but exactly what it is is still vague. Because of that, these advices are easier said than done. The take-home message is this "formula":
>### Challenging assumption = meaning shifting = perspective changing
For more detail you can read the [research proposal](https://lyminhnhat.com/research-proposal/?utm_source=SE%20%C2%BB%20Biology%20Profile&utm_medium=Research%20proposal&utm_campaign=Perspectives). You can also read [the theory itself](https://lyminhnhat.com/a-theory-of-perspective-full-text/?utm_source=SE%20%C2%BB%20Biology%20Profile&utm_medium=A%20theory%20of%20perspective&utm_campaign=Perspectives), but I should warn you that this is not a final product.

Thank you for your visit, and I hope you enjoy them. Have a nice day.
