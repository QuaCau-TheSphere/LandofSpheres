# [UPG Sustainability Leadership | United People Global](https://unitedpeople.global/nominations/upgsustainabilityleaders/?fbclid=IwAR3LbOO5yPmgP3HcMTa35yOUgZk5qaomrB36pT7Qk6HqfeVXz8u5jCvYMBo)
They are required to fulfill two objectives after the training:  
a) conduct a mini-training session and reach others  
b) design and lead a project within their community or their organisation.

We have saved 100 places (20% of the class) for candidates who have the support of at least one organisation - a company, a nonprofit, or an institution. The support of the organisation strengthens their capacity to make an impact after the training - this increases their chances of being selected. And in turn, the organisation benefits in various ways by having an individual who has received training in positive citizen leadership on sustainability. The candidate that you nominate will have better chances to get access to a global community of like-minded and highly motivated young leaders (aged 18 to 35). This is an asset for your organisation. The training is also FREE. And there are many more benefits.

As an organisation, please share with us:

**1 - The name of the candidate(s) that you are supporting;**
**2 - How you intend to support the candidate.** The main support would either be with  
a) helping the candidate with their mini-training session (e.g. providing IT support or a venue) OR  
b) helping the candidate to realise their project.

Dear Organizing Committee of UPG Sustainability Leadership,  

It is my pleasure to recommend Tuy√™n ƒêƒÉng Nguy·ªÖn Ph·∫°m (Ph·∫°m Nguy·ªÖn ƒêƒÉng Tuy√™n) for inclusion in UPG Sustainability Leadership.

This letter is my personal recommendation for Tuy√™n. As the founder and leader of The Sphere organization, I have been working with Tuy√™n for 7 months from June to December  2022. As a core member and program manager, he has helped build our organization and its values, actively providing critical feedback, firmly delivering working policy, setting up fundamental framework, and finding opportunities to cooperate with various individuals and organizations, to name a few. His contribution for our team is significant and irreplaceable.

He has left much of impression on me. From the very beginning when I just simply asked him if he wanted to join our new team, he accepted the offer immediately without much hesitation, with which I‚Äôm still impressed by his readiness. Shortly after, we had our first meeting to build our core values, while he was so busy taking care of a Cambodian cancer patient who needed to rely on him to communicate with Vietnamese doctors. His durability, productivity and activities are, again, impressive. Furthermore, within 2 months, he managed to initiate The Step program funded by MOVERS Programme and Lighthouse social enterprise. This was our big milestone to deliver an immersive training on SDGs parallelly with local culture and lifestyle for active youth in Vietnam from November 2022 and onward.

He has been an active member for many projects and programs in development, most focused on non-urban areas. He attended several international programs by YSEALI, ASEAN Foundation, Pacific Link Foundation, etc where his excellent diplomatic ability has built up a diverse social network of more than 500+ community leaders across Asia.¬†His motivation in 2023 is to reach out 500 youths in sustenable developments.

I can see beneath his enthusiasm for addressing pressing issues is a great deal of responsibility, a harmonious mind and a courageous soul. You can always entrust his efficiency, responsibility and personality, and you can find serenity when hanging around with him. I think the previous sentence is enough to convey my feeling about him. No more words are necessary.¬†

How do I intend to support him? He wants to build a website for his next project in 2023 for livelihood improvement in his home province Ninh Thu·∫≠n. There is currently no trusted digital platform for farmers in Ninh Thu·∫≠n for trading, and he wants to be the first one to work on this. This would require a decent amount of knowledge and skills in web technology, and I am more than happy to help him pass the learning phase. 

If I can be of any other assistance to you concerning Tuyen for the UPG Sustainability Leadership, please feel free to contact me at the address below.

Sincerely,

L√Ω Minh Nh·∫≠t
Founder of The Sphere
