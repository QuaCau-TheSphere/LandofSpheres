Dear Organizing Committee of UPG Sustainability Leadership,  

It is my pleasure to recommend Tuyên Đăng Nguyễn Phạm (Phạm Nguyễn Đăng Tuyên) for inclusion in ______.

# How you know the candidate
This letter is my personal recommendation for Tuyên. As the founder and leader of The Sphere organization, I have been working with Tuyên for 8 months from June 2022 to now. As a core member and program manager, he has helped build our organization and its values, actively providing critical feedback, firmly delivering working policy, setting up fundamental framework, and finding opportunities to cooperate with various individuals and organizations, to name a few. **His contribution for our team is significant and irreplaceable.**

**He has left much of impression on me.** From the very beginning when I just simply asked him if he wanted to join our new team, he accepted the offer immediately without much hesitation, with which I’m still impressed by his readiness. Shortly after, we had our first meeting to build our core values, while he was so busy taking care of a Cambodian cancer patient who needed to rely on him to communicate with Vietnamese doctors. His durability, productivity and activities are, again, impressive. Furthermore, within 2 months, he managed to initiate The Step program funded by MOVERS Programme and Lighthouse social enterprise. This was our big milestone to deliver an immersive training on SDGs parallelly with local culture and lifestyle for active youth in Vietnam from November 2022 and onward.

# Strengths and weaknesses of the candidate
I can see beneath his enthusiasm for addressing pressing issues is a great deal of responsibility, a harmonious mind and a courageous soul. **You can always entrust his efficiency, responsibility and personality**, and you can find serenity when hanging around with him. I think the previous sentence is enough to convey my feeling about him. No more words are necessary. 

# Seriousness of purpose
# Your estimation of the candidate’s leadership potential
He has been an active member for many projects and programs in development, most focused on non-urban areas. He attended several international programs by YSEALI, ASEAN Foundation, Pacific Link Foundation, etc where his excellent diplomatic ability has built up a diverse social network of more than 500+ community leaders across Asia. His motivation in 2023 is to reach out 500 youths in sustainable developments. **This is the proof for his seriousness and commitment as well as his leadership potential.**

# How you intend to support the candidate

**How do I intend to support him?** He wants to build a website for his next project in 2023 for livelihood improvement in his home province Ninh Thuận. There is currently no trusted digital platform for farmers in Ninh Thuận for trading, and he wants to be the first one to work on this. This would require a decent amount of knowledge and skills in web technology, and I am more than happy to help him pass the learning phase.

Sincerely,

Lý Minh Nhật
Founder of The Sphere
