Dear Ms.Nhi,  

Thank you for reaching out to me for referene.
It is my pleasure to provide details regarding my experience working with Tuyen at The Sphere.

I am the founder and general director of The Sphere company.
Tuyen was a Project and Content Coordinator.
Here, Tuyen was our highest-performance staff due to his great management skills and professional attitude at work (result-oriented and meticulous in details).
Handling a large amount of work made him struggle to stabilize his emotions at the workplace in the first 3 months (not to mention his distressing family issues), but eventually, he managed to overcome with splendid performance. 
With such achievement, Tuyen has never received any warning letter or negative comments during his working period at The Sphere.
He started work on 6th June 2021.
His last working date was 30th December 2023.
He has accomplished all relevant projects and desires to explore further opportunities regarding content, thus I support him in developing his career.
If Tuyen is willing to work in Vietnam, I would definitely like to rehire him for further projects.
According to his recent payroll, his gross salary received was 18.5 million VND. 
As far as I know, he also has a 2 million bonus monthly as top-performance staff, side commission (average 1.5 million each month), plus transportation allowance (1 million monthly).
I am happy to see that Tuyen is making progress in finding new working opportunities at your company. Should you have any questions regarding his working reference or suitability, please contact me.

Warm regards,

Ly Minh Nhat.

Dear Organizing Committee of UPG Sustainability Leadership,  

It is my pleasure to recommend Tuy√™n ƒêƒÉng Nguy·ªÖn Ph·∫°m (Ph·∫°m Nguy·ªÖn ƒêƒÉng Tuy√™n) for inclusion in ______.

# How you know the candidate
This letter is my personal recommendation for Tuy√™n. As the founder and leader of The Sphere organization, I have been working with Tuy√™n for 8 months from June 2022 to now. As a core member and program manager, he has helped build our organization and its values, actively providing critical feedback, firmly delivering working policy, setting up fundamental framework, and finding opportunities to cooperate with various individuals and organizations, to name a few. **His contribution for our team is significant and irreplaceable.**

**He has left much of impression on me.** From the very beginning when I just simply asked him if he wanted to join our new team, he accepted the offer immediately without much hesitation, with which I‚Äôm still impressed by his readiness. Shortly after, we had our first meeting to build our core values, while he was so busy taking care of a Cambodian cancer patient who needed to rely on him to communicate with Vietnamese doctors. His durability, productivity and activities are, again, impressive. Furthermore, within 2 months, he managed to initiate The Step program funded by MOVERS Programme and Lighthouse social enterprise. This was our big milestone to deliver an immersive training on SDGs parallelly with local culture and lifestyle for active youth in Vietnam from November 2022 and onward.

# Strengths and weaknesses of the candidate
I can see beneath his enthusiasm for addressing pressing issues is a great deal of responsibility, a harmonious mind and a courageous soul. **You can always entrust his efficiency, responsibility and personality**, and you can find serenity when hanging around with him. I think the previous sentence is enough to convey my feeling about him. No more words are necessary.¬†

# Seriousness of purpose
# Your estimation of the candidate‚Äôs leadership potential
He has been an active member for many projects and programs in development, most focused on non-urban areas. He attended several international programs by YSEALI, ASEAN Foundation, Pacific Link Foundation, etc where his excellent diplomatic ability has built up a diverse social network of more than 500+ community leaders across Asia.¬†His motivation in 2023 is to reach out 500 youths in sustainable developments. **This is the proof for his seriousness and commitment as well as his leadership potential.**

# How you intend to support the candidate

**How do I intend to support him?** He wants to build a website for his next project in 2023 for livelihood improvement in his home province Ninh Thu·∫≠n. There is currently no trusted digital platform for farmers in Ninh Thu·∫≠n for trading, and he wants to be the first one to work on this. This would require a decent amount of knowledge and skills in web technology, and I am more than happy to help him pass the learning phase.

Sincerely,

L√Ω Minh Nh·∫≠t
Founder of The Sphere
