# BUSINESS SUMMARY GUIDELINES

3.  You may attach a one-page business summary, picture, charts, or other data to your business plan as appendices at the back of the document after the Business Model Canvas (BMC).
4.  Please note that the sub-questions are only proposed guidelines to answer the questions. You may add additional information where applicable.
5.  Your application will be assessed on its:
	1.  **Social impact**: The scale of perceived positive change that the plan can realistically offer to the targeted community
	2.  **Innovativeness**: The level of creativity demonstrated in the specific solutions to the targeted social problems
	3.  **Feasibility and sustainability of the business model**: The degree of viability and ability to remain competitive in the long run
	4.  **Scalability**: The potential for the SE to expand in terms of operations and/or ease of replicating its business model within the home or overseas markets

## A. Business and Social Impact Plans
### Mission Statement
_List down the name of your SE and provide a short description of your SE._
Short description: `=[[4A Đám mây chim sáo lông vàng]].description`

### Social Issue(s)
_What is the current social issue(s) that your SE is trying to solve? Share with us if there were any proof of concept/pilot conducted to validate the social issue. What is the social impact of the SE idea?_

It’s hard for newfound independent projects to find collaborators. Although there are many organizations that want to promote an ecosystem between projects, the optimal outcomes (not saying the expected ones) aren't achieved. Especially if the idea is so novel. Since it takes a lot of time and cognitive workload to have deep conversations, often the project has to grow big enough to have a staff specialized in networking. 

For an ecosystem to operate effectively, the amount of energy spent to capture the signals of the environment must be reduced to almost zero. You do not need to ask and still know the needs of the stakeholders, and they don't have to ask to know what you need. An optimal ecosystem works by knowing the answers without needing to ask. And current project management tools do not have the ability of providing team information to other teams. **Until stakeholders' needs are stored right in the team's database before they look for it then we can begin to talk about an ecosystem where newfound organizations and projects can still benefit.**

### Value Proposition
*Describe your SE’s Value Proposition. How is your SE idea unique and how does it create value for your target customers?*

In the current market of task management and note-taking software, Obsidian, together with Git, seems to be a pair of tools that can support large-scale collaborations. The power of them lies in Obsidian's philosophies:

-   [Local-first](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/) and plain text
-   Link as first-class citizen
-   Make it super extensible

These philosophies enable a vast number of functionalities that a community building project would need. To name a few:

-   Community members can **passively contribute their insights, needs and other data** in a shared database, as a byproduct of managing their own projects
-   Via graphs, everyone can see the **big picture of the community**: which needs are needed most, who have the same needs with me, etc
-   There is **no limitation** when you need advanced features or when the team expands
-   With plugins, its functionalities can gradually expand depending on the needs and the current status of expertise of the users, making it a **cognitive scaffolding** to support part of the cognitive load, making it a medium of thought to augment our cognition

### Products and Services
*Briefly share about the products and/or services that your business will be providing and how does it address the social issue raised above.*

It isn't news that by centralizing data storage on servers, users' ownership and agency on their own data is taken away. It also isn't news that storing data locally solves this problem. In fact, this is the most basic method in data storing and everyone knows it. However, if you ask an average user to list some data storing solutions, they would very likely only name cloud apps like Google Docs or Notion. There is a reason for that: storing data on servers enables real-time collaboration excellently.

So there is a trade-off that every system designer has to face: do you want your users to retain full control on their own data, or do you want to enable real-time collaboration? This, by far, is still one of the hard problems in computer science.

However, real-time collaboration isn't necessary in most cases, but asynchronous collaboration. And there is an excellent tool for asynchronous collaboration for local-first data: Git.

So our service can be categorized as **technology education**: helping newfound organizations to acquire Obsidian and Git, to manage their project smoothly and form an efficient ecosystem.

### Rough Financial Projection
*How will the SE’s revenue, expenses, cash flow develop? How and when will you break even?*

Currently, all of our income comes from donations. We expect it to grow double this year.

Let's talk about the envisioned ecosystem in the form of a shared database. One of its vital features is a graph of the needs of individuals and organizations. All participants know which needs are needed most, who have the same needs as me, etc, and thus can figure out a way to satisfy their needs. Mostly via collaborating with others who have the same needs, or via exchanging the needs. If the network grows and operates as expected, after a tipping point, the percentage of satisfied needs of an entity will grow larger and larger. This makes the whole network function as an economy. Since the needs are satisfied without money involved, this is a **moneyless economy**.

So back to the question, it is possible to answer how the SE’s revenue, expenses, cash flow develop. But answering them should be considered as secondary. The better question should be how the ecosystem serves the needs of its members, or at least the SE's members.

## B. Market
### Briefly Assess the Competition
*Total available market, target market, how the market may evolve in future. What do competitors offer? How sustainable will your competitive edge be? You could also do a SWOT analysis.*

We are in the process of conducting market research so there is no solid evidence yet. Plus that many concepts from traditional economics may not be well applied in a moneyless economy or required to be modified. So currently we can't say much about the total available market or how the market may evolve in the future.

Our target beneficiaries are people who want to learn how to manage their life well, organizations who want to find a tool to manage their projects or build community efficiently, and anyone who wants to join a moneyless economy where you list your needs and cooperate with anyone who is also interested in having those needs served.

One competitor are **cloud solutions for business**, like Google Workplace or Microsoft 365. Their strengths:

-   Backed big companies: lots of money, lots of trust
-   Users already know how to use the tools well

Our weaknesses:

-   Coreteam cannot focus full-time on the project
-   Users have to spend a decent amount of effort to learn Obsidian and Git

### Marketing Plan
_What are your marketing plans? Which marketing channels will you be using? How do you sell your products and/or services?_

Words of mouth and Facebook posts, mostly. Not only there is a master vault for the ecosystem as a whole, but there will be specialized vaults for specialized topics. They will form knowledge bases for                                                                                                                                        experts in their fields to accumulate insights. It's similar to Wikipedia, but each page's title isn't a topic, but an insight. This is called [Evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C "Evergreen notes"). This will accumulate insight very fast, and everyone, from novices to experts still benefit from it.

## C. Goals
### Result Statement with Qualitative and Quantitative Goals
_Please provide quantitative and qualitative indicators of impact. E.g., To impact 200 women by 2024 and out of this, 50 women will be empowered to start their own business_

By 2024:
- 100 users (1 user = 1 person or 1 organization) visit the network once a week
→ 500 users should use Obsidian and Git to manage their life/projects.

- 500 users wanting to use Obsidian and Git to manage their life/projects
→ 1000 persons should read to the bottom articles about the advantages of the tools
→ 10000 people should know about the articles. That's 13 reaches/day.

- 50% of users report that they have their needs satisfied at least once at the end of this year

- 10 shared vaults have more than 3 frequent contributors
→ 50 vaults has more than 100 downloads

### Milestones
_What stages of development are needed? What long-term goals have you set?_

Currently we already have prototypes and are testing to get more feedback before announcing it widely. We are aiming at setting up 1 user interview per week.

We hope that in the next 3 months the first version of data auto-transferring between a user's vault and the shared vault will be released.

It takes 3 sessions to train 1 user from knowing nothing about Obsidian and Git. Assuming that 5 users would form an optimal class, it will be 300 sessions in 2 years, or 4 sessions per week.

Every October, the Obsidian community has an event to vote for products of the year. If we can get into the shortlist we can expose our work to the international market.

We hope that by the end of the year we will have a team of 5 that can work full time. Minimal living cost for 1 person is around S$300 per month. We would need to have S$1600 to pay for salary and other costs each month.

### Use of S$20,000 Funding
_Tell us what your plans are if you have S$20,000 to develop your SE?_

That's enough for a team of 5 to work fulltime for 12 months.
