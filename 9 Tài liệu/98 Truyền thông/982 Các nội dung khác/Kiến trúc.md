Fuller was influenced by [Alfred Korzybski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Korzybski)'s idea of [general semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_semantics). In the 1950s, Fuller attended seminars and workshops organized by the [Institute of General Semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_General_Semantics), and he delivered the annual [Alfred Korzybski Memorial Lecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Korzybski_Memorial_Lecture) in 1955.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckminster_Fuller#cite_note-49) Korzybski is mentioned in the Introduction of his book [Synergetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergetics_(Fuller)). The two shared a remarkable amount of similarity in their formulations of general semantics.[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckminster_Fuller#cite_note-50)

In his 1970 book I Seem To Be a Verb, he wrote: "I live on Earth at present, and I don't know what I am. I know that I am not a category. I am not a thing—a noun. I seem to be a verb, an evolutionary process—an integral function of the universe."

Buckminster Fuller was a [Unitarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitarianism), like his grandfather [Arthur Buckminster Fuller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Buckminster_Fuller),[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckminster_Fuller#cite_note-38)[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckminster_Fuller#cite_note-39) a Unitarian minister. Fuller was also an early [environmental activist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_activist), aware of the Earth's finite resources, and promoted a principle he termed "[ephemeralization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemeralization)", which, according to futurist and Fuller disciple [Stewart Brand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Brand), was defined as "doing more with less".[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckminster_Fuller#cite_note-40) Resources and waste from crude, inefficient products could be recycled into making more valuable products, thus increasing the efficiency of the entire process. Fuller also coined the word [synergetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergetics_(Fuller)), a catch-all term used broadly for communicating experiences using geometric concepts, and more specifically, the empirical study of systems in transformation; his focus was on total system behavior unpredicted by the behavior of any isolated components.

Ephemeralization, a term coined by [R. Buckminster Fuller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckminster_Fuller) in 1938, is the ability of technological advancement to do "more and more with less and less until eventually you can do everything with nothing," that is, an accelerating increase in the efficiency of achieving the same or more output (products, services, information, etc.) while requiring less input (effort, time, resources, etc.).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemeralization#cite_note-Fuller-Nine-Chains-1) Fuller's vision was that ephemeralization will result in ever-increasing standards of living for an ever-growing population despite finite resources. The concept has been embraced by those who argue against [Malthusian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malthusian) philosophy.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemeralization#cite_note-Fuller-Nine-Chains-1) The subsequently coined [economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics) term ["dematerialization"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dematerialization_(economics)) refers to essentially the same concept as also does [eco-economic decoupling.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eco-economic_decoupling)

"Ninety-nine percent of who you are is invisible and untouchable."

ko liên quan nhưng việc Buckminster Fuller được lấy đặt tên cho cấu trúc C60 có lẽ là từ việc ông ấy nổi tiếng với cấu trúc nhà mái vòm ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic_dome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic_dome)). Tuy nhiên cấu trúc này được thiết kế đầu tiên bởi Walther Bauersfeld cho một planetarium (toà nhà mô phỏng các chuyển động của thiên thể cho việc dạy và biểu diễn thiên văn học).

Buckminster Fuller đặt ra khái niệm ephemaralization (sự phù du hoá?), nghĩa là thiết kế ra một cái gì đó càng nhiều output càng tốt với càng ít input càng tốt cho tới khi nào có thể làm được tất cả mọi thứ mà không cần phải làm gì cả ("more and more with less and less until eventually you can do everything with nothing").
